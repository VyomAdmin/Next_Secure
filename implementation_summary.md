# NexCore Website Implementation

## Project Overview
I have created a high-conversion, enterprise-grade website for **NexCore**, a global consulting firm, following the requested "Swiss Design" principles.

### Key Features Implemented:
*   **Aesthetic**: Minimalist and authoritative, using Deep Navy (#002147) and Charcoal with a Crimson Red (#DC143C) action color.
*   **Typography**: Integrated Google Fonts 'Inter' and 'Montserrat' for a clean, modern look.
*   **Structure**:
    *   **Sticky Header**: Includes mega-menus, global presence toggle, and a clear "Contact Us" CTA.
    *   **Hero Section**: Features a high-resolution abstract architectural background with a bold value proposition.
    *   **Services Grid**: "Three Pillar" section (Consulting, Managed Services, Advisory) with hover effects.
    *   **Trust Signals**: Animated client logo ticker.
    *   **Interactive Maps**: A placeholder for the geographic reach visualization.
    *   **Responsive**: Fully responsive footer and layout modifications for mobile/tablet.

## Quick Start
The project is currently running on your local development server.

**URL**: `http://localhost:5173/`

### File Structure
*   `index.html`: Main semantic HTML structure.
*   `src/style.css`: All styles, including CSS variables and animations.
*   `src/main.js`: Interaction logic (sticky header, toggle, scroll reveal).
*   `public/hero.png`: Generated hero background image.

### Next Steps to Finalize
1.  **Replace Images**: Update the placeholder icons and the map visualization with actual assets.
2.  **Content**: Updates the text in the "Insights" and "About" sections with your real copy.
3.  **Deploy**: Run `npm run build` to generate a production-ready `dist` folder.
